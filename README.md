# Kvass Microbiome Project

## Overview

This project investigates the microbial diversity and functional potential of **sourdough-fermented kvass** formulations enriched with dietary fibre and botanicals. Conducted in collaboration with **Quas Drinks**, this study applies both **shotgun metagenomics** and **16S rRNA amplicon sequencing** to understand how different fermentation inputs shape microbial communities.

The research aims to create a **synbiotic** kvassâ€”combining **probiotics** from sourdough fermentation with **prebiotic** ingredients (inulin and ginger)â€”to support gut health through targeted microbiome modulation.

## Objectives

Hypothesis 1:
Sourdough Starters X and Y have significantly different microbial communities and functional gene profiles prior to fermentation.

Hypothesis 2:
Fermentation of kvass with a sourdough starter causes a major shift in microbial diversity and function compared to the original starter culture.

Hypothesis 3:
Using low-sugar and fibre (inulin) in kvass selectively enriches microbes and genes adapted to these substrates compared to standard kvass.

Hypothesis 4:
Even under the same fermentation conditions, different sourdough starters imprint distinct microbial and functional signatures on the final kvass.

Hypothesis 5:
Adding ginger to kvass alters the microbial community structure and functions due to the selective pressure of gingerâ€™s bioactive compounds.

Hypothesis 6:
Different kvass formulations and starter cultures lead to distinct functional potentials related to fibre degradation, SCFA production, and other health-relevant pathways.

## Methods

- **DNA Extraction**: Qiagen PowerSoil Pro Kit
- **Sequencing Platforms**:
  - **16S rRNA** (V3â€“V4): Illumina PE250 (~30,000 reads/sample)
  - **Shotgun Metagenomics**: NovaSeq X (2Ã—150 bp, ~6 Gb/sample)
- **Taxonomic Profiling**:
  - 16S: QIIME 2 + DADA2 + SILVA
  - Shotgun: MetaPhlAn3
- **Functional Profiling**:
  - Shotgun: HUMAnN3 (UniRef90 + MetaCyc)
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Alpha/beta diversity
  - Differential abundance (ANCOM, DESeq2, LEfSe)
  - PCA, heatmaps, and pathway enrichment

## Host Contaminant Filtering

Shotgun reads are filtered using Bowtie2 to remove eukaryotic contaminants:
- **Rye**: *Secale cereale*
- **Barley**: *Hordeum vulgare*
- **Ginger**: *Zingiber officinale*
- **Human**: *Homo sapiens*
- **Yeast**: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

## Data Output

The project will generate:
- Annotated 16S and shotgun sequencing data
- ASV tables, taxonomic barplots
